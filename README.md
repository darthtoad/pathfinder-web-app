# _Pathfinder Web App_

#### _A web app for Pathfinder tools._

#### By _**Sam Gespass**_

## Description

_This project is for the Pathfinder RPG. The first phase of the project is a character creator. Next, users will be able to save their characters and create an account as well as view a monster repository, create a monster and create a monster PC. The third phase is to allow a DM to create dungeons, puzzles, and other areas for the PCs to interact in. The fourth phase will allow DMs to create cities and maps, as well as putting cities, dungeons, and other sites on the maps. The fifth phase will actually allow a Pathfinder game to be played. At first, players will likely need to use other apps or services to communicate, but eventually text, voice, and even video could become options._
